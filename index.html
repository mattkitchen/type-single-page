                  The font Forma  was designed in the 1960s by Aldo Novarese and a team of eight designers at the Italian type foundry Nebiolo. It was created as a more human alternative to Helvetica. Some of the things the designers changed to differentiate themselves were, more distinction between characters, even higher x-height, Large counters and a One-story a and g. Forma was issued in metal over a decade after Helvetica and Univers. It never made the jump to phototypesetting and virtually disappeared after Nebiolo closed in 1978. In 2013, David Jonathan Ross created a digital revival of Forma called Forma DJR, other revivals of the Forma font include: OT Forma by Leonardo Azzolini, released in 2015 ,Forma Nuova by Tankboys in 2017 and KTF Forma by Victor Kharyk.                <h1>Supported Languages include:</h1>
